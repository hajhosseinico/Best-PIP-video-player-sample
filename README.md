**Best PIP Video Player Sample** is a beautifully structured Android app that showcases a modern Picture-in-Picture (PiP) video player with a clean, modular architecture. Built with **Clean Architecture** principles and following the **MVVM** pattern, the app offers a seamless video viewing experience that transitions smoothly between fullscreen and PiP modes. This app leverages **Jetpack Compose** for UI development and **Hilt** for dependency injection, ensuring efficient code management and scalability.

## üöÄ Features

- **Picture-in-Picture Mode**: Smooth PiP transitions, auto-enter and exit capabilities, with custom play/pause actions.
- **Clean Architecture**: Layered architecture for maintainable, testable, and scalable code.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Efficiently separates UI, data, and business logic with observable states.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Declarative UI with Material Design 3 styling for a modern look.
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**: Simplified dependency management using Hilt.
- **ExoPlayer Integration**: High-performance video playback with extensive customization options.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming for seamless user experiences.

## üì± Technologies and Libraries

### Core Libraries

- **AndroidX Core KTX**
- **Material Design 3**
- **ExoPlayer** for video playback

### Architecture Components

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Manages UI-related data with ViewModel for better separation of concerns.
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection framework to simplify object creation and management.

### UI

- **Jetpack Compose**: Build UIs declaratively and manage them efficiently with state.
- **Compose Navigation**: Easily navigate between screens in a modular fashion.

### Video Playback

- **ExoPlayer**: For smooth video playback with customizable PiP support.

### Dependency Injection

- **Hilt**: Dependency Injection for streamlined and efficient code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The app is structured using **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities and making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale.

1. **Presentation Layer**: Includes UI components using Jetpack Compose and ViewModel, following the MVVM pattern.
2. **Domain Layer**: Holds core business logic in UseCases, which keeps functionality isolated from data and UI layers.
3. **Data Layer**: Responsible for data handling, currently utilizing ExoPlayer for video sources.
